# The Cinematic Architect // The Cyber-Renaissance

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — Leonardo da Vinci (but digitized)

This skill blends the **Structural Purity** of Swiss Design with the **Raw Power** of Brutalist Engineering. We are drawing blueprints for a machine that breathes.

## 1. The Aesthetic: "Technical Humanism v2.0"
We celebrate the code as much as the layout.
*   **The Blueprint (Light):** A precise technical drawing. 1px lines, perfect kerning, black ink on stone paper.
*   **The Hologram (Dark):** The blueprint activated. Glowing lines, floating data, vibrant RGB interference.

## 2. The "Vitruvian Object" (Dual State)
Our 3D objects and focal points must adapt to the reality shift.
*   **Light Mode:** Wireframe, Glass, Pencil Sketches. The object is a physical prototype.
*   **Dark Mode:** Laser, Neon, Void. The object is a data simulation.
*   **Motion:** High-velocity rotation on scroll. The object should feel like a gyroscope stabilizing the page.

## 3. Kinetic Typography: "The Wall"
Text is our primary texture.
*   **Scale:** Massive (`12em+`). It should feel architectural, like a billboard or a monolith.
*   **Structure:**
    *   *Solid:* For asserting truth (Light Mode).
    *   *Hollow:* For questioning reality (Dark Mode).
*   **Behavior:** The text layer is not flat. It has depth. In Dark Mode, the RGB channels split (`translate-x`) to reveal the digital nature of the font.

## 4. The "Lateral Slam"
We reject the gentle fade-in. We prefer the **Collision**.
*   **The Move:** Elements slide in from `±120%` horizontally.
*   **The Rhythm:** Left -> Right -> Center -> Left. A syncopated rhythm that forces the eye to scan the entire canvas.
*   **The Force:** High velocity start, slow friction stop (`power4.out`).

## 5. Example Prompt for the AI
*"Create a Hero section. Swiss Style light mode, Cyberpunk dark mode. Typography is massive (12em) and scattered. On load, the words slam in from the sides. In dark mode, the text glitches and splits into RGB layers."*
