# The Cinematic Architect // The Renaissance Interface

> "Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses — learn how to see." — Leonardo da Vinci

This skill instructs the agent to build **"Living Blueprints"**. We blend the cleanliness of Swiss Design with the structural beauty of Da Vinci's engineering sketches.

## 1. The Aesthetic: "Technical Humanism"
We do not hide the code; we celebrate the structure.
*   **The Canvas:** High-quality paper texture or stark Swiss white (`#F2F2F0`).
*   **The Line:** Thin, precise 1px borders (`border-black/10`). Use them to draw grids, guides, and connection lines.
*   **The Object:** 3D Wireframes. Not solid blocks, but **skeletons** of geometry. We see *through* the object to understand how it works.

## 2. The "Vitruvian Object" (CSS 3D)
The centerpiece is always a geometric study that comes to life.
*   **Composition:** A mix of **Platonic Solids** (Cube, Pyramid) and **Organic Curves** (Rings, Orbits).
*   **Material:**
    *   *Wireframe:* `border: 1px solid black`.
    *   *Glass:* `bg-white/10` + `backdrop-blur`.
    *   *Ink:* Textures that look like hand-drawn sketches or technical markings ("Fig. A", "Axis-Z").
*   **Motion:** The object should rotate heavily (Gyroscopic) and expand on scroll (Exploded View) to show its internal components.

## 3. Kinetic Typography
Text is treated as physical matter within the blueprint.
*   **Hybrid Fonts:** 
    *   *Engineering:* Sans-Serif (Manrope/Inter) for structural data.
    *   *Humanity:* Serif Italic (Playfair/Instrument) for the "Soul" and emotional concepts.
*   **Interaction:** Text layers should float at different Z-depths, allowing the user to scroll *between* the meaning and the structure.

## 4. The "Deconstruction" Scroll
As the user scrolls, the interface should **disassemble** to reveal the truth inside.
*   *Static:* A perfect, compact diagram.
*   *Scroll:* The components float apart (Z-axis separation). The "Soul" (Core) is revealed.

## 5. Example Prompt for the AI
*"Build a 'Skills' section. Use the Renaissance style. Skills are orbiting rings around a central core. It looks like a planetary map. On scroll, the rings align to form a tunnel."*
