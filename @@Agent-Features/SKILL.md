# SKILL: FRONTEND ARCHITECT // THE SWISS ATELIER

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

This skill guides the creation of **High-End, Gallery-Grade Interfaces**. We are moving away from "Dark Mode/Neon/Cyberpunk" aesthetics towards **Architectural Light, Swiss Typography, and Physicality**.

---

## 1. The Aesthetic: "The White Cube"
The screen is a physical space, like a modern art gallery in Zürich or Tokyo.
*   **Base:** Warm Light (`#F2F2F0`, `Stone-50`). Never pure white, never pitch black background.
*   **Contrast:** Sharp, heavy typography in Jet Black (`#1a1a1a`).
*   **Soul:** Color comes from **Refraction** (Prisms, Glass, overlap) and **Motion**, not from decoration.

## 2. Design Thinking Principles
*   **Gravity & Physics:** Elements should feel like they have weight. If they float, they float because of a force (magnetism, wind).
*   **Asymmetry is King:** Center alignment is boring. Use the edges. Create tension between a massive title on the left and a tiny detail on the right.
*   **The "Impossible Object":** Every major section should feature one element that defies standard web layout (e.g., a CSS 3D Prism, a text that breaks into liquid, a layout that rotates 90deg).

## 3. The "Anti-Tech" Mandate
*   ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Matrix code effects, scanlines, neon glows on black backgrounds, "System Boot" sequences, gratuitous data dashboards.
*   ✅ **REQUIRED:** Serif/Sans contrast, massive whitespace, subtle grain, noise textures, fluid animation, architectural grid lines (visible or felt).

## 4. Operational Workflow
1.  **Clean the Canvas:** Start with Light.
2.  **Place the Anchor:** Drop the biggest typographic element possible.
3.  **Break the Grid:** Shift elements to create an "Editorial" look.
4.  **Inject the Soul:** Add the "Impossible Object" (The Prism, The Fluid, The Distortion).
